It works on\r\nhttp/https and has a built in permission/authentication system with the ability\r\nto authenticate via LDAP or ActiveDirectory. Kallithea also provides simple API\r\nso it's easy to integrate with existing external systems.\r\n\r\nKallithea is similar in some respects to GitHub_ or Bitbucket_, however\r\nKallithea can be run as standalone hosted application on your own server. It is\r\nopen-source donationware and focuses more on providing a customised,\r\nself-administered interface for Mercurial_ and Git_ repositories. Kallithea\r\nworks on Unix-like systems and Windows, and is powered by the vcs_ library\r\ncreated by Łukasz Balcerzak and Marcin Kuźmiński to uniformly handle multiple\r\nversion control systems.\r\n\r\nKallithea was forked from RhodeCode in July 2014 and has been heavily modified.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nKallithea requires Python_ 2.x and it is recommended to install it in a\r\nvirtualenv_. Official releases of Kallithea can be installed with::\r\n\r\n    pip install kallithea\r\n\r\nThe development repository is kept very stable and used in production by the\r\ndevelopers -- you can do the same.\r\n\r\nPlease visit https://docs.kallithea-scm.org/en/latest/installation.html for\r\nmore details.\r\n\r\nThere is also an experimental `Puppet module`_ for installing and setting up\r\nKallithea. Currently, only basic functionality is provided, but it is still\r\nenough to get up and running quickly, especially for people without Python\r\nbackground. See\r\nhttps://docs.kallithea-scm.org/en/latest/installation_puppet.html for further\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSource code\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe latest sources can be obtained from\r\nhttps://kallithea-scm.org/repos/kallithea.\r\n\r\nThe issue tracker and a repository mirror can be found at Bitbucket_ on\r\nhttps://bitbucket.org/conservancy/kallithea.\r\n\r\n\r\nKallithea features\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n- Has its own middleware to handle Mercurial_ and Git_ protocol requests. Each\r\n  request is authenticated and logged together with IP address.\r\n- Built for speed and performance. You can make multiple pulls/pushes\r\n  simultaneously. Proven to work with thousands of repositories and users.\r\n- Supports http/https, LDAP, AD, proxy-pass authentication.\r\n- Full permissions (private/read/write/admin) together with IP restrictions for\r\n  each repository, additional explicit forking, repositories group and\r\n  repository creation permissions.\r\n- User groups for easier permission management.\r\n- Repository groups let you group repos and manage them easier. They come with\r\n  permission delegation features, so you can delegate groups management.\r\n- Users can fork other users repos, and compare them at any time.\r\n- Built-in versioned paste functionality (Gist) for sharing code snippets.\r\n- Integrates easily with other systems, with custom created mappers you can\r\n  connect it to almost any issue tracker, and with a JSON-RPC API you can make\r\n  much more.\r\n- Built-in commit API lets you add, edit and commit files right from Kallithea\r\n  web interface using simple editor or upload binary files using simple form.\r\n- Powerful pull request driven review system with inline commenting, changeset\r\n  statuses, and notification system.\r\n- Importing and syncing repositories from remote locations for Git_, Mercurial_\r\n  and Subversion.\r\n- Mako templates let you customize the look and feel of the application.\r\n- Beautiful diffs, annotations and source code browsing all colored by\r\n  pygments. Raw diffs are made in Git-diff format for both VCS systems,\r\n  including Git_ binary-patches.\r\n- Mercurial_ and Git_ DAG graphs and Flot-powered graphs with zooming and\r\n  statistics to track activity for repositories.\r\n- Admin interface with user/permission management. Admin activity journal, logs\r\n  pulls, pushes, forks, registrations and other actions made by all users.\r\n- Server side forks. It is possible to fork a project and modify it freely\r\n  without breaking the main repository.\r\n- reST and Markdown README support for repositories.\r\n- Full text search powered by Whoosh on the source files, commit messages, and\r\n  file names. Built-in indexing daemons, with optional incremental index build\r\n  (no external search servers required all in one application).\r\n- Setup project descriptions/tags and info inside built in DB for easy,\r\n  non-filesystem operations.\r\n- Intelligent cache with invalidation after push or project change, provides\r\n  high performance and always up to date data.\r\n- RSS/Atom feeds, Gravatar support, downloadable sources as zip/tar/gz.\r\n- Optional async tasks for speed and performance using Celery_.\r\n- Backup scripts can do backup of whole app and send it over scp to desired\r\n  location.\r\n- Based on Pylons, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, Whoosh, vcs.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n**Kallithea** is released under the GPLv3 license. Kallithea is a `Software\r\nFreedom Conservancy`_ project and thus controlled by a non-profit organization.\r\nNo commercial entity can take ownership of the project and change the\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nKallithea started out as an effort to make sure the existing GPLv3 codebase\r\nwould stay available under a legal license. Kallithea thus has to stay GPLv3\r\ncompatible ... but we are also happy it is GPLv3 and happy to keep it that way.\r\nA different license (such as AGPL) could perhaps help attract a different\r\ncommunity with a different mix of Free Software people and companies but we are\r\nhappy with the current focus.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunity\r\n---------\r\n\r\n**Kallithea** is maintained by its users who contribute the fixes they would\r\nlike to see.\r\n\r\nGet in touch with the rest of the community:\r\n\r\n- Join the mailing list users and developers -- see\r\n  http://lists.sfconservancy.org/mailman/listinfo/kallithea-general.\r\n\r\n- Use IRC and join #kallithea on FreeNode (irc.freenode.net) or use\r\n  http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=kallithea.\r\n\r\n- Follow Kallithea on Twitter, **@KallitheaSCM**.\r\n\r\n- Issues can be reported at `issue tracker\r\n  <https://bitbucket.org/conservancy/kallithea/issues>`_.\r\n\r\n   .. note::\r\n\r\n       Please try to read the documentation before posting any issues,\r\n       especially the **troubleshooting section**\r\n\r\n\r\nOnline documentation\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nOnline documentation for the current version of Kallithea is available at\r\nhttps://pythonhosted.org/Kallithea/. Documentation for the current development\r\nversion can be found on https://docs.kallithea-scm.org/.\r\n\r\nYou can also build the documentation locally: go to ``docs/`` and run::\r\n\r\n   make html\r\n\r\n.. note:: You need to have Sphinx_ installed to build the\r\n          documentation. If you don't have Sphinx_ installed you can\r\n          install it via the command: ``pip install sphinx`` .\r\n\r\n\r\nConverting from RhodeCode\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nCurrently, you have two options for working with an existing RhodeCode\r\ndatabase:\r\n\r\n- keep the database unconverted (intended for testing and evaluation)\r\n- convert the database in a one-time step\r\n\r\nMaintaining interoperability\r\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nInteroperability with RhodeCode 2.2.X installations is provided so you don't\r\nhave to immediately commit to switching to Kallithea. This option will most\r\nlikely go away once the two projects have diverged significantly.\r\n\r\nTo run Kallithea on a RhodeCode database, run::\r\n\r\n   echo \"BRAND = 'rhodecode'\" > kallithea/brand.py\r\n\r\nThis location will depend on where you installed Kallithea. If you installed\r\nvia::\r\n\r\n   python2 setup.py install\r\n\r\nthen you will find this location at\r\n``$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Kallithea-0.1-py2.7.egg/kallithea``.\r\n\r\nOne-time conversion\r\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you would like to convert the database for good, you can use\r\na helper script provided by Kallithea. This script will operate directly on the\r\ndatabase, using the database string you can find in your ``production.ini`` (or\r\n``development.ini``) file. For example, if using SQLite::\r\n\r\n   cd /path/to/kallithea\r\n   cp /path/to/rhodecode/rhodecode.db kallithea.db\r\n   pip install sqlalchemy-migrate\r\n   python2 kallithea/bin/rebranddb.py sqlite:///kallithea.db\r\n\r\n.. Note::\r\n\r\n   If you started out using the branding interoperability approach mentioned\r\n   above, watch out for stray brand.pyc after removing brand.py.\r\n\r\nGit hooks\r\n^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nAfter switching to Kallithea, it will be necessary to update the Git_ hooks in\r\nyour repositories. If not, the Git_ hooks from RhodeCode will still be called,\r\nwhich will cause ``git push`` to fail every time.\r\n\r\nIf you do not have any custom Git_ hooks deployed, perform the following steps\r\n(this may take some time depending on the number and size of repositories you\r\nhave):\r\n\r\n1. Log-in as an administrator.\r\n\r\n2. Open page *Admin > Settings > Remap and Rescan*.\r\n\r\n3. Turn on the option **Install Git Hooks**.\r\n\r\n4. Turn on the option **Overwrite existing Git hooks**.\r\n\r\n5. Click on the button **Rescan Repositories**.\r\n\r\nIf you do have custom hooks, you will need to merge those changes manually. In\r\norder to get sample hooks from Kallithea, the easiest way is to create a new Git_\r\nrepository, and have a look at the hooks deployed there.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv\r\n.. _Python: http://www.python.org/\r\n.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/\r\n.. _Mercurial: http://mercurial.selenic.com/\r\n.. _Bitbucket: http://bitbucket.org/\r\n.. _GitHub: http://github.com/\r\n.. _Subversion: http://subversion.tigris.org/\r\n.. _Git: http://git-scm.com/\r\n.. _Celery: http://celeryproject.org/\r\n.. _vcs: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/vcs\r\n.. _Software Freedom Conservancy: http://sfconservancy.org/\r\n.. _Puppet module: https://forge.puppetlabs.com/rauch/kallithea\r\n",
